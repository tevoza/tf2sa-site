General rules:

Cheats and scripts:

- No cheats of any nature are allowed

- Usage of bugs are not allowed

- Usage of scripts that give clear unfair advantages are not allowed

- Players with known VAC bans for using cheats on another accounts are not eligible to play PUGs

- Ghosting is not allowed.

Player Conduct:

- Use of discriminatory language such as racist/sexist language is strictly prohibited.

- Abusive names and avatars are not allowed.

- Continued overly toxic behaviour that ruins the PUG experience for others is not allowed.

- All players must play to the best of their ability, intentionally playing worse for any reason is not allowed.

- Leaving before a game is over without getting a sub is not allowed except for when a game is generally considered to be basically over or if the reason for leaving is urgent.

- If a player has not joined the server after 10 minutes of the PUG filling and is not accounted for by someone else in the server, a sub can be called for said player.

- Having a player muted on your team during an ongoing PUG is not allowed.

Offclassing:

- Offclassing that can be deemed as unnecessary or detrimental to your teamâ€™s success is not allowed. Decisions on if an offclass was abused or not will be decided by the moderation team.

- If a player is thought to be abusing an offclass, it is the responsibility of any player in the server to report the incident in the event that no moderator/admin is present.

- As a guideline, try to keep your offclassing time below 5 minutes to make sure you keep clear of breaking offclassing rules, this is however not a hard limit and violations of offclassing rules will be
 looked at on a case by case basis.

Team selection:

- While captains ought to pick their best team possible, they must equally strive to pick a team that will lead to a balanced 6v6 experience.

- While the team captain has the final say to what class each player is assigned, they should try to be as considerate as possible regarding class preferences.


Other:

- A game that has reached a score of 3-0 with 20 minutes remaining is allowed to be conceded.

- For a game to be conceded, 7 players need to vote in favour of conceding the game.

- Players who are currently in an ongoing PUG are not allowed to add or queue to the next PUG until the current PUG is completed.

- If a game has not started within 25 minutes of the match filling with everyone ready, you are allowed to abandon said match.

- When looking for a sub for a player, players queued for the next PUG take priority in the order they have queued. If the queue is empty, the first player to join the server will be the sub.

- The moderation team reserves the right to amend these rules and implement such prospectively.

Punishment system:

- The punishment system for breaking the rules stated above will generally follow a system of 1st warning, 24 hour ban, 7 day ban, month ban and finally permanent ban.

- Violations of the rules that are considered extreme however can lead to more immediate serious punishments as deemed necessary by the moderation team.
